## Previous shipments

* We ship large amounts of wireless equipment across india. At any given point in time, we have about $1M worth of inventories at various stages to serve our customers.

## Customer Support

* Discord Channel and Email
* Round the clock customer support team
* SSH Remote access to address Gateway issues
* 1 Year Warranty for hardware
* Repair/Replacement : Defect due to manufacturing will be replaced at FOC.
* Warranty Exclusion Tempering, Misuse, Fire, Maintenance by an unauthorized method and Product not used as per user manual recommendations.

## Hardware Security

All the hotspot variants features a secure element, powered by ATECC608B from Microchip. And the key data to be secured (swarm keys, auth certificates, API tokens, etc) are kept in a separate partition which is encrypted and secured by using the secure element.
In addition to that, the firmware upgrade process is also secured with encryption over the wire and at rest. And the firmware updates applied after verification of the authenticity of the payload.

* Are you using an ECC608? Yes
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware? Yes
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures? Yes
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Partial. No potting. But we try to keep communication secure as much as possible. 
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail): Yes

## Hardware Information
* Evidence of a functioning prototype - Yes
* What are your plans for software setup and configuration for the devices - Configuration access will be possible through app and remote dashboard. 
* Which security implementation (ECC608, TPM, TrustZone, other) are you using?  ECC608
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway - SX1303
* What is the CPU - Arm64 A35 Quad core (1GHz Max)

## Manufacturing Information

We have our own manufacturing facilities as well as long standing relationships with third party vendors. We have been delivering products and solutions across metering, sensing and communication all over India.
We have made mistakes and slowly evolved our process to have strong QC and track and trace capabilities over every step of the process.
**TODO:: we need to fill some unique things here like special awards, manufacturing licenses etc.**

## Proof of Identity

To be submitted in private and confidential manner.

## Budget & Capital

We plan to build these products in batches of 1k units initially to avoid any unforeseen bugs and potential recalls. We will slowly pacing the outputs to 10k batches based on demand. We believe the requirements of capital can be met from our existing cash flows without any stress. We have strong credit lines if we see explosive demand of these products.

## Risks & Challenges

The main risk is the ongoing covid supply shocks which are expected to last longer than anticipated. We have long standing relationships with vendors and have been able to source components till now for our needs. This is something beyond our control and we can only hope that we will continue to have sourcing success.
